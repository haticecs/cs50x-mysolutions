1. get the user input by get_string("Text: ")
2. find number of letters, words and sentences.
        -LETTERS -> upper and lowe case 
        if (s[i] >= 'a' && s[i] <= 'z')
        {
            printf("%c", s[i] - 32);
        } 
        (use similar logic)
        -WORDS -> seperated by SPACE
        number of spaces doesnt equal to the numbe rof spaces ex. 5 words has 4 spaces between them
        -SENTENCES -> ended by  !, ?, . 
        print them first to check.
3. calculate the grade algrotihm 
 index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8 
 (L is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text,
 and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.) -> use round and cast to float not to get int return
 if >= Grade +16
 if < 1   Before Grade 1
 4.print to the console (Grade + index )
