1. Get the key from command line using the structure of
int main(int argc, string argv[]) 
(argc is the argument count, or number of arguments, and argv is an array of strings that are the arguments)
!key should be digit -> valid digit so you need to check the every character in the given key 
!arc can be just 2 (2 arguments: /.caesar 5) -> print Usage: ./caesar key in these situations

2. Convert key to the integer, key is taken as an string
3. Get plain text with get_string()
4. Encipher that plain text-> shift it by key
    in loop
    if not alphebetic character -> leave them as they are
    if alphabetic 
    1.Convert ASCII to alphabetical index
    2.Use Formula  ci = (pi + key) % 26; 
    3.Convert ASCII (add 65 if upper case, add 97 if lower case)
5. Print it to the console
use these functions;
isalpha 
isupper
islower
5.
